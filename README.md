I developed a classic Snake game using Python and its libraries, including tkinter and turtle. Highest Score
tracking is done using json data file. In the game, players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes
balls, with the goal of avoiding collisions that lead to the snakeâ€™s demise. The graphical interface is
implemented using tkinter and turtle, providing a visually engaging experience for players Event dates
