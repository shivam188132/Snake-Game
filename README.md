# Snake Game

Welcome to Snake Game! This project implements a classic Snake game using Python and its libraries, including tkinter and turtle. Players control a snake that grows longer as it consumes balls, with the goal of avoiding collisions that lead to the snakeâ€™s demise. The game includes features such as highest score tracking using JSON data files and a visually engaging graphical interface implemented using tkinter and turtle.
